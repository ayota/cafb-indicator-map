#Capital Area Food Bank Health Indicator Map
##Background
The Capital Area Food Bank and other organizations working in the food insecurity space could use more granular data on key health indicators to better serve their clients. Most of these data -- such as obesity and diabetes rates -- are only available at the county level. It would be most useful for CAFB to have data at the US Census Tract level.
